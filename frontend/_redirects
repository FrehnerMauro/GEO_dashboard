# Cloudflare Pages redirects file
# This file is used by Cloudflare Pages for routing

# API routes should be proxied to Workers (Production only)
# Note: In development, the frontend uses http://localhost:8787 directly via config.ts
# Uncomment this line for production deployment on Cloudflare Pages:
# /api/*  https://geo-platform-backend.maurofrehner.workers.dev/api/:splat  200

# SPA fallback - serve index.html for all routes
/*    /index.html   200
